### Endpoints

 I have 3 APIs:

|  API  |  Path  | Ver.|                                         Endpoints                                                              |
|-------|--------|-----|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| User  | /user  | /v1 | /create_user, /get_user, /update_user, /delete_user                                                            |
| Score | /score | /v1 | /get_game_score, /get_user_scores, /get_all_scores, /get_user_ranking, /get_leaderboard                        |
| Game  | /game  | /v1 | /new_game, /get_game, /guess_char, /get_user_games, /get_user_completed_games, /cancel_game, /get_game_history |

### Scoring Impl

Current scoring logic is straight forward, no. of guesses left when player guesses the word is his/her score. But down the path we will have score game depending upon the word length/toughness.

### Ranking Impl

For ranking players, game is using [TrueSkill](http://trueskill.org/). 

TrueSkill is a rating system among game players. It was developed by Microsoft Research and has been used on Xbox LIVE for ranking and matchmaking service. This system quantifies playersâ€™ TRUE skill points by the Bayesian inference algorithm. It also works well with any type of match rule including N:N team game or free-for-all.

The game is using [Head-to-head (1 vs. 1)](http://trueskill.org/#head-to-head-1-vs-1-match-rule) match rule to rank players.

### Game Word Generator

For generating game words, project is using [RandomWords](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/RandomWords/0.2.0) python module.  

What were some of the trade-offs or struggles you faced when implementing the
new game logic?

- Firstly, on what game to implement, because the more the game deviated from
  the reference code base (hangman) the more work / complexity / time
  would be required to complete the project. I ultimately decided on
  hangman as it was quite a bit more complicated than guess-a-number,
  , but wasn't so complicated that it would takes months to complete. 


- There was quite a lot of thought (struggle) in deciding the games modes, but
  eventually just decided to implement both two and more players modes each
  with unique high scores.

- The idea of consecutive turns as a high score was appealing but didn't fit
  into traditional scores for either single or two player games, so decided to
  implement it as a bonus score for all game modes!

- I don't like writing duplicate code, but I had to trade-off a lean API for a broader
  range of endpoints with quite a bit of duplicate code. It seems that this is
  a problem with API endpoints in general though, where they tend to grow in
  the number of endpoints and duplicate code as time goes on to support ever
  growing functionality.
